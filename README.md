image recognition with python
In this code, i used the MobileNetV2 model, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network architecture that has been trained on the ImageNet dataset. I defined a function preprocess_image to preprocess the input image by resizing it to 224x224 pixels and normalizing the pixel values. The predict_image function takes an image path as input, preprocesses the image, and makes predictions using the pre-trained model. It returns the top 3 predicted labels and their confidence scores.

To use the code, replace the image_url variable with the URL or local file path of the image you want to recognize. The code will download the image, make predictions using the model, and display the image along with the predicted labels and confidence scores.

Please note that for more advanced image recognition tasks, you may need to train your own custom model on a specific dataset that is relevant to your desired object, face, or pattern recognition task. This code provides a basic example using a pre-trained model for general image recognition.
